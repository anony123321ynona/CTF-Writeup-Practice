## Write-up: üìù

As we login, we can see an alert: `Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!`

It requires the browser we're using is "PicoBrowser". So we use Burpsuite to intercept our request and modify UA header `User-Agent: PicoBrowser`. Then forward the request. Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent

The warnings: `I don't trust users visiting from another site.`

As we're accessing this site from another site, it don't trust us. So we have a way to prove that we're visiting from its sites. We have **Referer** header which notifies server the page where user get in it from. Add **Referer** header `Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:39114/` . Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer

The warnings: `Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.`

This time, we have to get a "time machine" to get back to 2018. We can use **Date** header to specify the year **2018** to bypass. Add **Date** header: `Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT`. Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Date

The warning: `I don't trust users who can be tracked.`

We avoid tracking by using **DNT** header. Add **DNT** header and set to 1 `DNT:1`. Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/DNT

The warning: `This website is only for people from Sweden.`

We could specify the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server by **X-Forwarded-For** header. Add this header with the IPs in Sweden that we searched ([some samples](https://www.nirsoft.net/countryip/se.html). Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For

The warning: `You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?`

We use **Accept-Language** header to indicate the languages user wants. Change this header `Accept-Language: sv`. We can look up language code abbreviation in [here](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php). Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language

Payload (all needed headers):
```
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
Referer: http://mercury.picoctf.net:39114/
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2018 07:28:00 GMT

#### The Flag (for reference): ‚úîÔ∏è
