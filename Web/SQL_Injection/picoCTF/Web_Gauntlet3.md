## Write-up: üìù
This challenge only have 1 round

## Solution: üíØ

Filters: `or and true false union like = > < ; -- /* */ admin`

In the given hints, this chall don't filter **spaces**. We could use `IS NOT NULL` or `IS NOT` keywords to pass the **password** , but we need to close the string with must-have single quote so  our **password** is like (`'a' IS NOT 'b'`). The username is still the same with **concatenation operator** `ad'||'min`

User: `ad'||'min` 

Pass: `a' IS NOT 'b`

Then move to **filter.php** file to get the flag.

#### The Flag (for reference): ‚úîÔ∏è
