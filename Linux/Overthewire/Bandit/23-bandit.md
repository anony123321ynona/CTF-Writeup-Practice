# Level 23 - Level 24 ‚úî
- **Level Goal:**:<br>
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.<br>
**NOTE 1:** This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!<br>
**NOTE 2:** Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around‚Ä¶<br>
- **Commands you may need to solve this level:**<br>
cron, crontab, crontab(5) (use ‚Äúman 5 crontab‚Äù to access this)<br>

## Write-up: üìù<br>
In this chall, we have to connect to port 30000 on localhost and we have to send a string containing the current password. <br>
Like many previous chall again, with this **"cron"**, we have to know what **cron** file do to understand more about it: `cat  /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit24`<br>
