# Level 16 - Level 17 ‚úî
- **Level Goal:**:<br>
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don‚Äôt. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.<br>
- **Commands you may need to solve this level:**<br>
ssh, telnet, nc, openssl, s_client, nmap<br>

## Write-up: üìù<br>
In this chall, we have to connect to port 30000 on localhost and we have to send a string containing the current password. <br>
Use `man nc` for more details
### Solution:<br>
- Connect securely (SSL encryption) to localhost:30001: `openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001`
